TabNU - Web Presence using Tabs
===============================

License - AGPL-3.0
http://tabnu.com

Django application that manages a tree of the web presence nodes in a database,
and exposes them via clean recursive tabs. Everything about the target object 
can be found on one single page.

It runs well for ~1 year with mysql+nginx+runfcgi on a 20$/Month VPS from 
Slicehost (referal: http://tinyurl.com/djangopro)
